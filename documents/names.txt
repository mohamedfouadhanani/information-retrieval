106$ Growth and Decay Curves in Scientific Citations .A MacRae, Duncan Jr. .W    In a rapidly advancing scientific discipline, new contributions will  supersede older ones.. This selection in favor of recent literature should be observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of  the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and  clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application  suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences.
